                <p class="mb-4">You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Swarify or through a third party either by:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li>paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or</li>
                    <li>pre-payment giving you access to the Swarify Service for a specific time period ("Pre-Paid Period").</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription directly from Swarify, this is offered to you by Swarify India LLP and your transaction for the Paid Subscription is with Swarify India LLP, as a distributor of Swarify AB, and is subject to these Terms. For information on the security of the payment methods available for purchase of a Paid Subscription directly from Swarify and the contact information of these payment providers, please visit their website. If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your access of the Swarify Service in addition to these Terms. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Swarify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Codes"), you hereby agree to the Swarify <a href="#" class="text-green-600 hover:underline">Card Terms</a>.</p>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Price and tax changes</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Swarify may from time to time change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes (defined above), and will communicate any price changes to you in advance on reasonable notice. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, by continuing to access the Swarify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory or even city. Any change in Tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide</p>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Swarify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our Customer Support team <a href="#" class="text-green-600 hover:underline">here</a> for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Swarify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Swarify Service.</p>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Withdrawal right</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the withdrawal right for the Paid Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends fourteen (14) days after you start the Trial. If you don't cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorise Swarify to automatically charge you the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription. For trials less than fourteen (14) days, you expressly consent to us providing you with the paid service immediately after the end of your Trial and that from that point you lose your right of withdrawal.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to withdraw for any reason and must pay us for the services provided up until the time you tell us that you have changed your mind. You expressly consent to us providing you with the service immediately following your purchase, that you lose your right of withdrawal, and authorise Swarify to charge you automatically each month until you cancel.</p>
